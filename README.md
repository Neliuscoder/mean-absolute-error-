# mean-absolute-error-
In this repository, I explore how to calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) metric for evaluating the accuracy of a machine learning model. The code demonstrates how to implement MAE in Python, as well as how to interpret and use the metric to improve model performance. Check out the code and feel free to provide feedback or suggest improvements.
